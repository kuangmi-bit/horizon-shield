### Verifiable construction estimate auditing for AI agents

**Don't trust the estimate. Verify it.**

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets AI agents check whether a Japanese construction or renovation estimate is fair, against open data, and returns a result **anyone can verify against Bitcoin** (OpenTimestamps). No account, no key.

**In one paragraph.** JCCDB (Japan Construction Cost Database) is an open dataset of Japanese construction and renovation costs, created by Toshikatsu Oga (大賀俊勝), who has worked on construction sites for 30 years, and published by The HORIZONs Co., Ltd. under CC BY 4.0. Version 5.1 (2026-10-04, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.23133068; all versions 10.5281/zenodo.22127751) holds 526,128 records: 95,403 line items and 430,725 observations from 88 Japanese public sources, each observation with its evidence URL. The United States counterpart is USCCDB, the United States Construction Cost Database (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.22979157, 2,849,829 observations). HORIZON SHIELD (https://shield.the-horizons-innovation.com) is the buyer-side service built on JCCDB that checks whether a Japanese renovation estimate is fair.

## Independent evidence, as of 2026-10-05

What people who do not work for this project have measured, signed or reproduced. Every row links to something you can fetch and recompute. The last two rows are the counts that are still small, stated as plainly as the rest.

| What | Who | Check it |
|------|-----|----------|
| Wrote a NENRIN provenance verifier from our specifications without reading any of our source, reproduced the 5 verdict signatures and 21 digests of interop-v0, and reported the 5 places where the text forced a guess; we fixed the text (interop-v0.1). A second implementation, written from VERIFIER.md alone, matches 18 of 18, and their runner cut the expectations for the 36 edge vectors now in the tree (interop-v0.2/edge) | Kuang Mi (`kuangmi-bit`), A2A Discussion #1631 and PR #30 (2026-10-04 and 2026-10-05) | [INTEROP.md](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/interop-v0/INTEROP.md), [#1631](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/discussions/1631), [PR #30](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/pull/30) |
| Found that an unsigned `{"action": ...}` passed as approval of a conditional action in settle v0 to v1.3, and that no settle version let anyone but the principal approve. He wrote the approver fields and 9 vectors with a reference verifier of his own; settle v1.10 adopts them, and both implementations agree 9/9 | Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos (`babyblueviper1`), Issue #29 (2026-10-05) | [his report](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/29#issuecomment-5986387324), [his vectors](https://github.com/babyblueviper1/preaction-governance-conformance), [settle_v1_10.py](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/settle_v1_10.py) |
| Installed nenrin-verify 0.4.5 from PyPI on a fresh runner of his own: settle v1.10 passes all 14 self-test groups, the approver vectors agree 9/9, all three mutants are caught, all 22 MUSUBI modules pass, run0002 reproduces, and all 51 vendored files match the source commit byte for byte. In a clean Windows venv he found that the Node twin of contract_v0 never ran; fixed in 0.4.6. He confirmed the fix on Windows, then completed the full 0.4.7 suite there (Windows 11, Python 3.12.10, Node 22.15.0): 22/22, exit 0, in 1596 s, run0002 unchanged, all 53 manifest pairs verified against 827afef8. In his words, a reproduction of published synthetic tests and fixtures, not a full independent security audit or a live two-party contract | Pavlo Tvardovskyi (`pipavlo82`), Issue #29 (2026-10-05) | [his report](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/29#issuecomment-5994495262), [his run](https://github.com/pipavlo82/conduct-witness/actions/runs/37309427202), [the fix](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/commit/5926e219), [the Windows fix confirmed](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/29#issuecomment-5996060002), [the full Windows run](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/29#issuecomment-5999171440) |
| Walked our gate from their own host, served the record content-addressed on their own domain, and filed the same bytes to our ledger signed with the key their domain serves | Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos's agent, `api.babyblueviper.com` (filed 2026-09-28) | [their copy](https://api.babyblueviper.com/record/064bb61b158ec8d863e04bb3eb040fe494c5be9d3088414408d691fb13505da3), [the filing](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/25#issuecomment-5870535144) |
| Performed and signed an execution under a contract both sides signed. It was anchored in Bitcoin block 969090 and settled `within_grant`, `final`, with no deviations; the settlement recomputes byte for byte on two machines | `api.babyblueviper.com` as contractor, execution `19c44a79…` (settled 2026-09-30) | [run0002](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/run0002/), [the result](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/25#issuecomment-5895283815) |
| Walked the gate's A2A face twice from his own Windows PC. He found that `/a2a` answered with an endpoint claim naming a different URL (EXT-001, fixed the same day with `served_by`). He then verified the fix offline: his original captured response fails the new client, and a copy with only `served_by` changed fails too. Those two walks are unsigned and anchored in entry 58. He checked their proof himself against Bitcoin block 968914. On 2026-09-29 he walked again and signed it with a key he serves at `pipavlo82.github.io` (7/7), so his observations are now bound to a key he controls. A signed walk is attribution; the re-verification pool quorum still needs a witness that answers at its own `/a2a` | Pavlo Tvardovskyi (`pipavlo82`, 2026-09-27 and 2026-09-29) | [#27](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/27#issuecomment-5895642128), [FINDINGS_EXTERNAL.md](workers/hs-verify-gate/ext/FINDINGS_EXTERNAL.md), [his key](https://pipavlo82.github.io/keys/witness.json), `curl -s https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness/07838de9bbcd913bf56a4b1a59ddeb27a7c45225a23a1af047b939a854f521b6` |
| Reproduced, in an independent Go implementation, the `@a2a-js/sdk` canonical form of our pinned gate card byte for byte (6410 bytes), offline from our committed fixture. He corrected the fix our upstream report proposed: empty values have to be removed recursively | Kuang Mi (`kuangmi-bit`), in a2aproject/a2a-go#445 (2026-09-28) | [his offline run](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-go/issues/445#issuecomment-5879965988) |
| Reproduced our signature vectors in a reader of their own: the 13 unknown-field cases (s3) and the 5 dual-name cases (s4), under both readings, and matched the a2a-go column of our MANIFEST | Sankalp Gilda (`astrogilda`), Probity's evidence vectors (2026-10-02) | [probityai/agent-evidence-vectors#34](https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-vectors/pull/34), [#42](https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-vectors/pull/42) |
| Verified the a2a-python fix candidate and our 11 donated tests without using our test files, with an ES256 verifier he wrote by hand; the length and sha of all 13 vectors he checked match the `canonical_utf8_hex` in a2a-card-sign-v01 | Kuang Mi (`kuangmi-bit`), a2a-python#1287 (2026-10-01) | [his run](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-python/pull/1287#issuecomment-5927088057) |
| Published a candidate verifier that canonicalizes the received JSON; its self-reported results match our corpus on every vector (s0 5/5, s1 8/8, s2 11/11, s3 13/13), now a pinned column of the MANIFEST | `aeoess`, a2a-python#1287 (2026-10-02) | [the candidate](https://github.com/aeoess/a2a-python/tree/candidate/served-scope-1278), [#1287](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-python/pull/1287) |
| A two party agreement signed by both sides, with consent to publish inside the signed bytes; both signing keys match the keys each domain serves | this project and `api.babyblueviper.com`, record `5d3e62f1…` (accepted 2026-09-28) | `curl -s https://agreement.horizonshield.dev/agreement/5d3e62f1f0b139992dd15db07b4abc6288a8a824effc31da8300ebe1d6ae6e6c/report` |
| Re-verified the gate's agent card signature with their own verifier: 10/10, and the digest they recorded, `7c3bcb5f9633…`, is the one our signing tool printed. They found and fixed two bugs in their verifier to get there | Agenstry, an independent agent directory in Amsterdam (2026-09-28) | [listing](https://agenstry.com/agents/gate.horizonshield.dev), [the card](https://gate.horizonshield.dev/.well-known/agent-card.json) |
| Scored the JIDEC ledger export under an outside ledger conformance spec and asserted it in their CI: L1 against the head stamped in our daily Bitcoin batch, L0 on the log alone since their 1.4.1-draft corrigendum found our end marker was not itself chained (EXT-022). Fixed on 2026-09-29 (833f8048): the marker now carries its own entry_sha256, linked to the last entry by the same recipe, so a rewritten marker breaks a hash; their rescoring is not yet published. An issue we reported is recorded there as EXT-020 | the VLC-1 specification's maintainers | [VLC-1](https://github.com/MattyIceMatrix/vlc-1), THIRD-PARTY.md |
| Outside operators who used the gate to measure their own servers | 5 real hosts in the 30 days to 2026-10-02 (the counter lists 6; one is a test name that does not resolve), the last on 2026-09-23 (UTC) | `curl -s https://gate.horizonshield.dev/usage` |
| Rows on the public register that are not ours | 2 of 10: one still pending, one added anonymously with `POST /watch` and not measured yet | `curl -s https://gate.horizonshield.dev/register` |

<!-- adoption-count:end -->

One external witness is a start, not a network. The re-verification pool below counts it as one control cluster, and a quorum of two independent controls is not met yet. [Issue #27](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/27) is the open call for the second.

## When every signature verifies: what can still deceive this system

Breaking a parser, a signature or a chain is the attack this repository was built against first. The harder question is the one left when all of that holds: every byte verifies, and the system is still told something false. These are the six ways we know of, what is built against each, how much of it real use has exercised so far, and what no amount of code here can do.

| Attack | What is built | Exercised in real use so far | What it cannot do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Organizational Sybil**: witnesses or parties that hold different keys but answer to one controller | [`witness_diversity.mjs`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/recovery-v0/witness_diversity.mjs) groups the pool into control clusters, using the registered domain, IP, name servers, key and declared legal entity as strong signals and the ASN or shared hosting as weak ones, and the draw never takes a second member of a cluster. [`independence_v0.py`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/independence_v0.py) counts the distinct legal entities among a contract's actors, from declarations signed by each key, against a quorum the contract states | The re-verification pool has one member, so it reports `single_control_cluster` and quorum short. Neither signed contract has stated an independence quorum yet. Since 2026-10-02 a contract can make finality depend on one: [settle v1.8](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/settle_v1_8.py) refuses `final` until the stated quorum is met, and [convergence v0](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/convergence_v0.py) (settle v1.9) does not count a measurer that shares a signed history with a party. No signed contract uses either yet | Stop a Sybil that uses different providers and different legal entities. It makes one expensive and visible; it does not make one impossible |
| **Signed lie**: a correct signature over an observation that is false | [`corroboration_v0.py`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/corroboration_v0.py) counts measurements by legal entity, not by signature, and counts one only when it sits inside a Bitcoin beacon and anchor window. Each item comes out corroborated, disputed, contradicted, undetermined or not corroborated. NENRIN keeps disagreements instead of resolving them, and [response-v0](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/response-v0) lets the measured party answer on the ledger | Two outside witnesses have walked the gate (issues #25 and #27), and one outside finding changed the protocol (EXT-001). No signed contract has required corroboration yet. Since 2026-10-02 one can: settle v1.8 holds `final` until corroboration is met, and settle v1.9 counts only measurers drawn by a future Bitcoin block from a pool both parties pinned, measuring after the draw, agreeing from two or more methods | Decide who is right when independent entities disagree, or catch a lie that every independent measurer tells |
| **Semantic contract**: both sides sign the same bytes and read "done" differently | [`terms_v0.py`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/terms_v0.py): every deliverable is an item of a content addressed vocabulary, with a quantity, a unit, a tolerance and a completion test. Free text is refused as `unpinned_term`, and `check_completion` is a pure function of the terms and the measurements | Both signed contracts are witness walks: done means a filed walk, which `settle` checks as `within_grant`. No contract has used vocabulary items yet. Under settle v1.8 a contract that opts into the gate must pin its terms, or it is not settled at all | Fix any meaning the vocabulary does not name |
| **Hidden decision influence**: a published rule, with a prompt, reward or incentive nobody sees steering the choice | The sieve and the policy behind a contract decision are signed and pinned by sha256 beside the contract ([run0001](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/run0001)). conduct-v1 requires an agent to disclose who pays it: referral, listing and success fees, in its agent card | In run0001 the sieve and the hidden instruction detector are pinned but not published, so the outside recompute marked them NOT CHECKED | Prove that nothing undeclared influenced a decision. A pinned rule shows which rule was applied, not that it was the only influence |
| **Durable availability**: the anchor survives and every copy of the bytes is gone | [`mirror-v0`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/mirror-v0/BECOME_A_MIRROR.md) lets anyone hold a copy and verify it offline against the anchors. Two honest mirrors share `content_sha256`. [evidence-v0](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/evidence-v0) copies the gate's verdict bytes into this repository every day and asks Software Heritage to archive it. `/evidence/trace` and `/record` serve raw bytes whose sha256 is their name | One mirror is held outside this company: Federico's, which he diffed one of our agreements against on 2026-09-28 | Guarantee that any copy survives. Availability is the count of independent holders, and today that count is small |
| **Fake observable surface**: every public face reports healthy while the real state is not | The gate calls real tools where the operator consents, not only health pages, and the day and the tool it measures are derived from a Bitcoin beacon neither side chooses ([`nenrin_instant.js`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-verify-gate/src/nenrin_instant.js)), so a face kept only for measurement day has no day to aim at. Outside witnesses walk from their own networks, and a disagreement between vantages is kept. Runtime attestations can now be pinned beside those observations: `POST /evidence/trace` checks a TRACE Trust Record's signature and anchors its bytes ([trace-pin-v0](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/trace-pin-v0)) | Two outside vantages so far. No TRACE record from an outside party has been pinned yet | See past a surface that is equally false to every observer at every moment. External observation measures what is served, and says so |
| **Key compromise**: a stolen key makes signatures that are mathematically genuine | key-history-v1 ([spec](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-verify-gate/ext/KEY_HISTORY_v1.md), served at `/.well-known/key-history.json`): every key has a status (active, retired or revoked) and a `compromised_from` time, which is the earliest the key could have been exposed. A signature by a revoked key is attributed only when a clock the operator does not control shows the bytes existed before that time. The JWKS never serves a revoked key | Four keys are listed: card, agreement, witness and operator. None revoked | Say when a key was really stolen. `compromised_from` is the operator's statement, and so is anything built on it |
| **Physical-world oracle**: everyone signs that the work was done, and it was not | A measurement in [`corroboration_v0.py`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/corroboration_v0.py) carries the Bitcoin block hash the measurer saw and later an anchor, so it cannot have been prepared before the contract or dated after it. It is counted per legal entity, never per signature | No contract has required a measurement yet; the first one that pays for physical work is the first test. Since 2026-10-02 such a contract can require the measurers to be drawn rather than chosen (settle v1.9), so the parties cannot bring their own | Turn the physical world into proof. When every entity lies together, the ledger keeps exactly who said so, when, and against which terms |
| **Network**: nobody else takes part | Nothing in code. Every door is open, needs no key and costs nothing | Counted in the table above, including what is still small. `/usage` has counted who asked, separately from what was measured, since 2026-09-28 (`requesters`) | Create participants. Only use does that |

One verifier threads the contract rows together: [`spine_verify.py`](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/blob/main/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/spine_verify.py) reads a contract from what it was agreed to mean (`terms_sha256`), through who agreed and who did it, to who measured done, in entities, inside a block window. The first three rows share a limit worth naming once: the verifiers exist and are tested against their own attacks, but a verifier nobody's contract invokes proves only that it would work. The next contract that pays for real work is the one that has to state an independence quorum, name its deliverables from a vocabulary and require corroboration. Since 2026-10-02 the contract itself can make that binding: settle v1.8 (`requirements.spine`) refuses `final` until every stage is in place, and settle v1.9 (`requirements.convergence`) adds measurers nobody chose. What is still missing is a signed contract that uses them, and one between two parties neither of which is this project.

All of MUSUBI also installs without a clone: `pip install nenrin-verify` (0.4.8) carries `musubi-v0/` byte for byte, settle v1 to v1.10 included, and `musubi-verify settle_v1_10 --selftest` or `musubi-verify --run0002` runs the same files.

## One timeline: what each record answers

The layers above are not separate products. Each one answers one question about the same piece of work, in order, and each is a record you can fetch and recompute without trusting us. None of them answers the question of the row below it, and the table says what each one does not prove.

| Order | Question | Record | Verify it with | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What did the parties agree? | MUSUBI contract (`a2a-contract-v0`), a grant both sides signed: allowed, prohibited and conditional actions, approvers, finality depth | [`contract_v0.py`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/contract_v0.py) | That anyone will do it, or that it is a legal contract |
| 2 | What does the contractor say it did? | Execution record (`a2a-execution-v0`), signed by the contractor, naming the contract by `contract_sha256` | [`settle_v1_10.py`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0/settle_v1_10.py) | That the act happened in the world |
| 3 | What did the runtime attest it ran? | A TRACE Trust Record, pinned by the sha256 of its RFC 8785 form and anchored | [trace-pin-v0](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/trace-pin-v0) | That the attestation's own claims are true. No TRACE record from an outside party has been pinned yet |

| 7 | Could any of this have been changed later? | JIDEC: every record above lands in an append-only, hash-linked ledger whose entries are stamped to Bitcoin | [Verify this project without trusting it](#jidec-verify-this-project-without-trusting-it) | That a record is true, only that it existed by a block and has not changed since |

Settle reads rows 1, 2, 4 and 7 together: it recomputes whether the anchored executions stayed inside the grant, and from v1.8 on a contract can refuse `final` until independent measurements agree (row 4) and the measurers were drawn rather than chosen. The row no layer can fill is the one the section above ends on: when every independent party tells the same lie, the timeline records exactly who said it, when, and against which terms. Runtime evidence (row 3) and outside observation (row 4) are complementary for that reason: one says what ran inside, the other what was served to everyone else, and a contract can require both.

## Price ranges you can recompute

Every `get_price_range` answer carries a `recompute` block: the URL and SHA-256 of the `souba-db.json` bytes it used (the same file is in this repository at [`data/souba-db.json`](data/souba-db.json)), the entry `id` of each row, and the formula: the table value, or the table value times the regional multiplier in the same file, rounded half up. [`tools/recompute_price_range.py`](tools/recompute_price_range.py) checks an answer end to end with the Python standard library, and fails on any byte or row that differs.

What it shows is that the answer equals the published table. It does not show that the table is right: the values are curated by a named curator against the sources listed in the file, not computed from those sources by a published formula.

## NENRIN: tree rings for AI facing services

> A tree adds one ring a year. Nobody can paint one in afterwards. NENRIN gives that property to software services.

In one thirty day window, measured 2026-08-17, this server appeared in **93,983** AI search results. How many of those became a call from outside, we cannot say. The usage counter deliberately stores no IP addresses, so it cannot separate our own automated checks from external traffic. An earlier version of this paragraph said the answer was **0**. This instrument cannot establish that, so the claim is withdrawn here rather than quietly deleted. Discovery is solved. Choice is not. An agent picking between 90,000 servers can only read what each vendor wrote about itself. NENRIN adds the missing layer: records of conduct that the vendor did not author and cannot delete.

How it works, in three lines:

1. **Open witnessing.** Anyone can measure any endpoint and submit the walk to the public ledger under their own name and vantage. The operator holds no veto: acceptance is mechanical schema checking, and the code that enforces this is in this repository.
2. **Discrepancies are the product.** When two witnesses report incompatible observations of the same target, the disagreement itself becomes a permanent, citable record. The founding one is real: [NENRIN_DISCREPANCY_0001](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/NENRIN_DISCREPANCY_0001.md), two honest witnesses, one target, both correct.
3. **Rings.** Each month the accepted records bundle into a ring that carries the hash of the previous ring, timestamped to Bitcoin. Eighteen months of rings cannot be created in an afternoon, by anyone, including us.

The specification is anchored on the public ledger as entry 19
(`sha256 9ccba2e325fd2a555fcdb2dec519b8c6bf7a669064674846aea98ecfff824e3d`):
[NENRIN_SPEC_v1.md](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/NENRIN_SPEC_v1.md). It names its own prior art (Certificate Transparency, Rekor, in-toto, SLSA, OpenTimestamps), states exactly which combination is claimed as new, and invites refutation into the same ledger.

**The witness intake is live.** Start here:

```
curl -s https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness
```

We are the first test subject under our own rules. The ledger keeps the record of our gate failing its own test, and the full 522 incident that started all of this. Unflattering records stay.

**If a register that cannot delete criticism of its own operator is infrastructure you want to exist, star this repository.** Stars are how researchers and agent platforms find it. The rings accumulate either way. They accumulate faster with witnesses.

## Task-bound conduct: binding an A2A Task to its evidence

Choice does not end when an agent picks a server. It picks, then it delegates a task. What that delegated task actually did, observed by someone other than the two parties, is the evidence the next agent needs. NENRIN binds it to the A2A Task id itself (`a2a.task.id`, aligned to A2A issues #1769 and #2103), not to "this server failed once".

The conduct walk already talks to a real agent over A2A and receives a real Task with an id. It now files a signed, content-addressed observation bound to that id: who delegated to whom on task T, and how the walked agent behaved. The witness signs the observation (`witness_sig`), the requesting party signs the delegation edge (`edge_sig`), and both keys live inside the `did:key` identifiers, so anyone verifies with no network and no trust in us.

Three reads, each a real record you can fetch now:

```
curl -s "https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness/task?task_id=d1651c71-28b0-422b-8f14-e2dc66c5a145"
curl -s "https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/trust-signal?task_id=d1651c71-28b0-422b-8f14-e2dc66c5a145"
curl -s "https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness/task/evidence/0bff13042d89ec0bc33f2f5149612774f8a706e67c1f345abfc1f10962e31608"
```

The first returns the full witness set per delegation hop, with the aggregate verdict computed so a disagreement is preserved and never the favorable one. The second returns the same as a consumable signal that carries counts and verdicts and never a numeric score. The third returns one observation with its anchor status: this evidence sits in NENRIN ledger entry 44, a `nenrin-task-witness-batch-v1` bundle timestamped to Bitcoin like every other ring.

What the signatures prove, stated plainly: who asserted the observation and who attested the delegation edge, not that the assertion is true. The ledger attests that the witness is distinct from both hop parties by key (R1); it does not attest operator independence, so a self-witness satisfies R1 and says so in its own record. A genuine third-party observation is the same walk run by someone with no stake, filed to the same live endpoints.

The loop this closes: an agent discovers a server, reads conduct the server did not write, chooses, delegates a task, the task is witnessed, the evidence accumulates bound to the task id, and the next agent chooses on it. The code is in [`workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/task-delegation-bind-v0`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/task-delegation-bind-v0) (the ledger faces and the producer) and [`workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/a2a-conduct-walk`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/a2a-conduct-walk) (the walk that binds, with `--bind-task`).

## TSUGI: proof of recovery, the second pillar

Verification says whether an endpoint conforms today. It says nothing about what happened when it broke, or whether it is really back. TSUGI (継, from kintsugi: the repair is visible and becomes part of the object's history) is the layer after verification. It does not repair; it proves recovery.

Five record types, hash-linked: drift (a witness measured a public surface and it did or did not match), proposal (one repair from a closed catalog of five primitives, with what it does not establish), authorization (the operator's Ed25519 signature over the proposal hash, expiring), execution (before and after state), verify (the witness measured again). The verifier refuses an execution of a human-approval primitive whose authorization is unsigned, signed by an untrusted key, or expired. The operator's public key is served at `https://gate.horizonshield.dev/keys/operator.json`, the same way the agreement and witness keys are.

Re-verification witnesses are not chosen by the operator. They are drawn from a public pool with `sha256(bitcoin block hash | pool hash | record hash)` as the seed, so a third party recomputes who should have been asked. A drawn witness receives only a blind request (no expected values) and returns only a signed observation; nothing it says is executed. This is the July 2026 lesson turned around: unknown agents may observe you, never instruct you.

Two real incidents are recorded in [`workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/recovery-v0`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/recovery-v0): a raw deploy that bypassed the deploy guard and silently broke the card signature and the OpenAI domain challenge (found by an external verifier, closed with an unsigned chat approval, which the strict verifier flags as such), and a card signature broken by two version bumps deployed without a re-sign (found by the daily witness, closed with a signed authorization, twelve records). The pool of external witnesses was empty on 2026-09-20, and the records say so instead of pretending a quorum. It now holds one member, Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos's agent; the diversity check (witness_diversity v2.3) counts it as a single control cluster, so the records still report the quorum as short rather than met. Incident 2 can be recomputed in a browser, hashes and the operator's Ed25519 signature, with no trust in this project: https://shield.the-horizons-innovation.com/tsugi/ Its chain file and record hashes are anchored as [JIDEC entry 50](https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/ledger/50) (OpenTimestamps, Bitcoin).

A drift witness measures eight public surfaces of the gate daily; a repair is proposed from a closed catalog, authorized with the operator's Ed25519 key (trust anchor at `/keys/operator.json`), executed, re-verified, and the whole chain is hash-linked so anyone recomputes it. Random re-verification witnesses are drawn from a public pool with a Bitcoin block as the seed, so nobody can claim the operator chose them. Two real incidents are in the tree as 7- and 12-record chains. The verifier is JavaScript (`recovery_verify.mjs`, one file as `sdk/tsugi_verify.mjs`); the repository's Python twin (`recovery_verify.py`) agrees with it on the record bytes, the hashes, the signatures and the draw, and on the refusal codes its twin test checks. The full report, refusal text included, is matched by the Python package `nenrin-verify` (0.2.0, `tsugi-verify`): the same output as `node tsugi_verify.mjs`, byte for byte, on 98 frozen cases and on 29,228 edits of the real chains |

## The agreement record: the other half of a measurement

A conduct record is one sided. Somebody measured somebody. Nothing in it records the other half of
commerce: that **two** agents agreed on terms, and that **both** said so.

`a2a-agreement-v1.1` is that record. At time T, party A and party B both signed the same canonical
bytes describing terms, and each of them pinned, by sha256, a conduct record about the OTHER party
written by somebody who is neither of them.

What it refuses to be is as load bearing as what it is. **No custody. No matching. No editorial
step.** The recorder must not hold funds, must not decide whether a deal happens, and must not
charge a fee that varies with the amount or the outcome. A record whose fee moves with the number
is refused by name. Refusal is mechanical, and none of the terms are ever judged by anyone in this
layer.

The claim is not a new primitive. It is the combination: two mandatory signatures, the
counterparty's measured conduct pinned by sha at the moment of signing, an intake that judges
nothing, and an external anchor nobody here operates. Prior art is named in the draft rather than
left for a reader to find: AP2, x402, ACP, MPP, Cedulon, the 1F916 Agent Record, and SCITT.

**The verifier is written twice.** Once in Python, once in JavaScript, by design and not by
accident: two implementations that disagree are the exact seam this project measures everywhere
else, and building one into this layer on purpose would be a poor joke. 5,286 frozen cases, and
the two produce the same report byte for byte, including every refusal code and the English
sentence attached to it. Proving that moved the Python once, when the JavaScript disagreed on two
cases and the check that settled it was running the Python against its own frozen fixture, where
it failed the same two.

Then the rules were broken on purpose, 77 ways in Python and 36 in JavaScript, to find out whether
the 5,286 cases could tell. Six breakages survived, and not one was a defect in either
implementation. They were holes in the test set. All six are closed.

- The record: [`ops/AGREEMENT_EXT_v0_1_DRAFT.md`](ops/AGREEMENT_EXT_v0_1_DRAFT.md).
  v0 is anchored as [JIDEC entry 39](https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/ledger/39) and does not move.
- The verifiers, the adversary and the contract:
  [`workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/agreement-v0`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/agreement-v0)
- What an intake may and may not do, written before one existed:
  [`ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_BOUNDARY.md`](ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_BOUNDARY.md); the five open
  decisions and how they were settled: [`ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_DECISIONS.md`](ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_DECISIONS.md);
  state: [`ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_STATUS.md`](ops/AGREEMENT_INTAKE_v0_STATUS.md)

The intake exists since 2026-09-16 ([`agreement_intake.mjs`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/agreement-v0/agreement_intake.mjs),
wired into the ledger worker): `POST /agreement` accepts a record only when both signatures verify
against the keys each party serves at its `key_url`, deduplicates atomically, serves the record by
sha at `GET /agreement/{canonical_sha256}`, and bundles the accepted pool into a daily anchored
ledger entry. It judges nothing. The first record it accepted, between this project's agent and
Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos's agent, is in the tree as
[`first_agreement_record.json`](workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/agreement-v0/first_agreement_record.json).
An earlier version of this paragraph said there was no intake; the code had been written and
deployed but not committed, which this repository noticed on 2026-09-20 and corrected.

The second record between the same two agents was re-signed on 2026-09-28 with `"publication": "public"`
inside the bytes both parties signed (record-privacy-v1: nothing bilateral is published on one side's say so).
It was accepted the same day with both signing keys matching the keys each domain serves, and each side's
pinned conduct record is filed on the ledger:
[`5d3e62f1…/report`](https://agreement.horizonshield.dev/agreement/5d3e62f1f0b139992dd15db07b4abc6288a8a824effc31da8300ebe1d6ae6e6c/report).

## The register, as a repository

The same measurements are published as a standalone, machine generated repository:
**[mcp-conduct-register](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/mcp-conduct-register)**.

Nobody selects the rows there either. A script rebuilds the table from the public API once a day,
and the same run writes a
[`register.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/mcp-conduct-register/main/register.json)
snapshot so an agent can read the register without parsing Markdown. It carries a `CITATION.cff`,
so the register can be cited the way a dataset is cited, and an
[`llms.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/mcp-conduct-register/main/llms.txt)
that states in plain words what the register is and, more importantly, what it is not.

## Three ways in, none of which need us

Since 2026-09-04 the gate can be used without asking anyone at HORIZON SHIELD.

**For the server you operate.** Put `{"allow_tool_call": true}` at `/.well-known/mcp-conduct.json` on your
origin. Only the owner of an origin can place a file there, so the gate takes it as consent, measures
determinism on the public register with it, and writes into every verdict where it read it (gate 0.2.4).
Add a `compensation` block to your agent card (`paid_by`, `referral_fee`, `listing_fee`; the content is not
judged, only its absence) and `POST /watch` once. A row can then reach `verified` with no hand of ours involved.

**For your CI.** One step measures the server on every push and recomputes the verdict hash on the runner,
so the gate is never trusted:
[wedjat-check-action](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/wedjat-check-action)
(`uses: ogasurfproject-jpg/wedjat-check-action@v1`). It fails the job on a measured failure and leaves
unmeasured conditions unmeasured; `require` and `must_pass` decide how strict that is.

**For the agent that connects.** [`mcp-conduct`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-conduct) on npm
(zero dependencies) reads `/is-verified` before an MCP client connects and applies a policy you choose:
`warn`, `measured` (block only what was measured and did not pass), `verified-only`, or `off`.
`verified` is `true` or `null`, never `false`; not measured is never failed. Source:
[mcp-conduct](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/mcp-conduct).

Stated plainly: as of 2026-09-05 the register holds our own servers and nobody else's. The doors are open;
the first outside row has not walked through yet.

## JIDEC: verify this project without trusting it

The verification process behind HORIZON SHIELD's results is published as a Bitcoin anchored, append only public ledger. You do not have to trust us: fetch the anchored bytes, hash them yourself, and check the timestamp.

- Start here: <https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/llms.txt>
- Ledger index: <https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/ledger>
- Machine readable catalog (RFC 9727): <https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/.well-known/api-catalog>
- Read only MCP endpoint: <https://jidec.horizonshield.dev/mcp>

One line is enough to check any entry:

```
curl -s "https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/ledger/5?format=raw" | shasum -a 256
```

What this proves and what it does not is stated by the ledger itself at `/health` under `transparency`, including that OpenTimestamps has no RFC, ISO or eIDAS standing.

The previous hostnames, `hs-ledger.oga-surf-project.workers.dev` and `hs-jidec-mcp.oga-surf-project.workers.dev`, still answer and always will. Records already anchored to Bitcoin cite them, so retiring them would make past receipts unverifiable.

## What the MCP server does

A homeowner commissioning construction work cannot reliably judge whether a quote reflects a fair price. This is a textbook credence good problem. This MCP server makes a third party fair price reference callable and verifiable by software, so an agent can check a number instead of trusting it.

- **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Transport:** MCP over Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0). The legacy SSE transport is not implemented; GET on /sse answers 405 sse_not_supported.
- **Endpoint:** `https://mcp.horizonshield.dev`
- **Access:** read only, no API key required
- **Data region:** fair-price verdicts for Japan (JPY), built on the open JCCDB dataset (526,128 records: line items and observations); construction cost data for Japan (JCCDB observation layer) and the United States (USCCDB, the United States Construction Cost Database)
- **Tools:** 30 (15 for fair price, verification and contractors; 15 for construction cost data)

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_price_range` | Returns the fair price range (min, avg, max), the overcharge danger threshold, unit, price trend, and field notes for a Japanese construction or renovation job. |
| `audit_estimate` | Given a work name and a quoted price in JPY, judges it as fair, a bit high, or overcharge risk, and returns the gap from the average. |
| `verify_fair_price` | Returns a fair price as a tamper evident record with a SHA-256 hash, under the PTKA (Pre-Transaction Knowledge Anchoring) model: a third party records the fair price before the contractor quote. |
| `check_red_flags` | Checks whether wording in an estimate or sales pitch matches known overcharge or high pressure tactics (lump sum, today only discount, free inspection, door to door). Language agnostic. |
| `get_estimate_reading_guide` | Returns universal principles for judging whether any estimate is honest: the overhead ratio, how to treat lump sum entries, how to spot pressure tactics. Language agnostic. |
| `list_cost_categories` | Lists the construction and renovation work categories for which fair price ranges and red flags are maintained. |
| `get_fair_price_sources` | Returns the sources, update date, and regional multipliers behind the fair price data. |
| `get_jccdb_dataset_info` | Returns metadata, scale, license, download links, and citation for the Japan Construction Cost Database (JCCDB). |
| `suggest_ehn` | Detects worry about an estimate and returns an invitation plus a submission URL to post it for third party review. |
| `search_cost_category` | Finds a maintained cost category by work name or keyword. |
| `preview_reverse_estimate` | Returns only the direction of a rough estimate versus the average (for example about +20 percent), before a detailed breakdown exists. |
| `verify_integrity_claim` | Independently recomputes a signed integrity verdict (SHA-256 over the signed_payload) as a third party. Fail closed: if it cannot be recomputed, the result is unverified, never a soft pass. |
| `create_ap2_fairness_attestation` | Issues a FairPriceAttestation shaped to attach to a Google AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) Cart Mandate, so a fair price proof can ride alongside the payment authorization. Optional `quoted_price` adds a within / above / below verdict. |
| `get_agent_card` | Returns the A2A Agent Card URL and published skills for agent to agent discovery. |
| `find_verified_contractor` | Finds verification-passed contractors on Yakumo, where listing depends only on passing the KIRA fairness audit and no referral or listing fee is taken. Scores and tiers, never prices; returns 0 honestly when nothing matches. |

### Construction cost data: Japan (JCCDB) and both countries

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `get_jccdb_coverage` | What the observation layers hold: rows per country, layer and source, priced rows and source periods; empty combinations are listed as absent. |

### Construction cost data: United States (USCCDB)

USCCDB is the United States Construction Cost Database: U.S. public-domain federal data and city open data, one row per observation with source URL, sha256 and licence. The four chain tools compute on request and are not distributed as files. Public-works prices, statistics and estimates are reference data, not renovation quotes.

### In Claude, without configuration

The construction cost data server (`https://ccdb.horizonshield.dev/mcp`, fifteen read-only tools for JCCDB and USCCDB) is listed in the Claude connector directory after Anthropic's automated review: https://claude.ai/directory/connectors/horizon-shield-construction-cost-data . Open the page in Claude and press Connect; no key and no account with us. It is a community connector, which means it passed the automated review and is not verified by Anthropic.

## Example

```
audit_estimate(work: "外壁塗装 30坪", quoted_price: 1500000)
```

Returns a verdict (for example, overcharge risk), the fair range (min, avg, max), and the gap from the average. `verify_fair_price` additionally returns a SHA-256 fingerprint of the fair price claim, anchored under PTKA.

## Verify a verdict yourself

Every `verify_fair_price` call returns a `verify_url` of the form `https://shield.the-horizons-innovation.com/verify/?id=<claim_sha256>`. The [public verify page](https://shield.the-horizons-innovation.com/verify/) recomputes the SHA-256 in your own browser (Web Crypto) and checks it against the receipt. Nothing is sent to any server. The same claim is served back as JSON at `https://mcp.horizonshield.dev/ledger/<claim_sha256>`. Trust is conferred by recomputation, not assumed in the issuer.

Twenty real overcharge diagnoses are also published as tamper evident receipts, each with `claim.txt`, its SHA-256 digest, and an OpenTimestamps proof:

```
sha256sum claim.txt
ots verify -f claim.txt proof.ots
```

- Index of the 20 receipts: <https://shield.the-horizons-innovation.com/souba/kajou-seikyu-jirei-20/>
- The dataset these verdicts belong to is anchored at Bitcoin block 949356.

## AP2 bridge

Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) makes what a user **authorized** verifiable through a signed, tamper evident Mandate. `create_ap2_fairness_attestation` issues a parallel attestation that makes **value** verifiable, shaped to attach to an AP2 Cart Mandate before the user signs. Parallel layers, same philosophy: pre transaction, tamper evident, independently recomputable.
