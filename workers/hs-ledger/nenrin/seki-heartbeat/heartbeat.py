SEKI heartbeat: the first door works every day, whether or not anyone else calls it, and every day is settled.

The door (hs-seki-door) stands in front of HORIZON SHIELD's own paid tool, hs-gateway /report, for the store
hs-seki-demo, under the demonstration contract musubi-v0/run0003/contract.json. Principal, agent and door are all
The HORIZONs Co., Ltd., and the contract says so. A door that is only exercised on the day it was built proves little,
so once a day this file does two things, and the scheduled workflow .github/workflows/seki-heartbeat.yml commits what
they wrote under runs/<UTC date>/:

  run      The agent makes the same three calls as run0003, each with a fresh nonce:
             report   20 tickets, the limit is 20      must be admitted, run, and filed as an execution record
             audit    30 tickets, the limit is 25      must be refused amount_over_limit, nothing spent
             compare  50 tickets, prohibited           must be refused prohibited_action, nothing spent
           Every record the door signs is checked here under the key keys/seki-door.json publishes and must be on
           the ledger. Anything other than the expected answer is a failure (exit 1), so a broken door shows up as a
           failed run, not as a quiet gap.
  settle   Every earlier day whose records the ledger has batched and Bitcoin has confirmed is settled with
           settle v1.15 (and v1.12, which must agree on the verdict). The anchors are composed with anchor_compose
           from the ledger's own batch bytes and .ots proofs; the header view comes from two explorers, extended
           from final headers kept in view-chunks/ (written once, never rewritten) and checked again in full every time. Days not yet confirmed are left for a
           later run. settlement.json and the anchored records are written next to the day's records.

Only the agent's key is used here (SEKI_AGENT_SEED_B64, the 32 byte Ed25519 seed in base64, from the repository's
Actions secrets) with the store's gateway token (HSG_STORE_TOKEN). The agent can do nothing the contract does not
allow and the tickets of the pilot carry no monetary value. The door's key never leaves Cloudflare and is not here.
