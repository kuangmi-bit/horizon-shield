# SEKI heartbeat

Once a day the agent calls HORIZON SHIELD's own paid tool through the SEKI door under the demonstration contract (../../musubi-v0/run0003/contract.json): a report inside its limit, an audit over its limit, a comparison the contract prohibits. The door must admit the first and refuse the other two, and every answer is a signed record on the public ledger. Once the ledger's batch is confirmed in Bitcoin the day is settled with settle v1.15. Principal, agent and door are all The HORIZONs Co., Ltd.; it is a demonstration, not an outside customer, and the pilot's tickets carry no monetary value. heartbeat.py and the workflow seki-heartbeat.yml write this folder.
