// nenrin-trace-pin-v0 (2026-09-29): pin a TRACE Trust Record to the NENRIN ledger by its sha, so the exact
// bytes outlive TRACE's own 24 hour freshness window and carry a clock the issuer does not hold.
//
// Why this exists. A TRACE Trust Record (agentrust-io/trace-spec v0.2, Linux Foundation) answers "what ran,
// where, under which policy": an Ed25519 signature by the key in cnf.jwk over the RFC 8785 form of the record.
// Its time is iat, which the issuer writes. Spec 3.2.2 has verifiers reject a record older than 24 hours by
// default, so a record that proved something today cannot be checked by a conformant verifier next month, and
// nothing in the record bounds iat from outside. The ledger adds the missing half: it checks the signature at
// intake, keeps the exact bytes, and anchors their sha in the daily batch that is stamped to Bitcoin. After
// that, anyone holding the record can show these bytes existed before a block the issuer could not choose,
// and that a verifier found the signature valid while the record was fresh.
//
// What it is not, stated in every answer: it does not make any claim inside the record true (TRACE says the
// same of its own signature), it does not establish that the key belongs to the subject (the key is the one
// the record carries; compare key_thumbprint with a key you already trust), and it performs no revocation
// check. It reads the embedded-signature form only; enveloped JWS or COSE records are refused by name.
//
// The module is additive and self contained: Web Crypto only (no node: imports, the Worker has no nodejs_compat),
// its own KV prefix tpin:, and one dispatcher that returns null for any path that is not its own.
