# nenrin-verify (Python)

Recompute NENRIN evidence yourself, offline, in your own Python process. The Python twin of the npm package
[`nenrin-verify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nenrin-verify) and of the TSUGI recovery-chain verifier
`tsugi_verify.mjs`: same input, same report (the limits are listed under "Where the claim stops"). It also carries
the MUSUBI contract verifier, which is written in Python, byte for byte.

    pip install nenrin-verify
    nenrin-verify --selftest          # 31/31 frozen bundles and 98/98 TSUGI chains match the JavaScript; MUSUBI run0002 recomputes
    nenrin-verify bundle.json         # the provenance report; exit 0 accepted, 1 refused
    tsugi-verify chain.json --operator-key <b64>   # a TSUGI recovery chain, printed as node tsugi_verify.mjs prints it
    musubi-verify contract_v0 --verify contract.json   # a MUSUBI module, run exactly as python3 contract_v0.py in the repository

```python
import json, nenrin_verify as nv

bundle = nv.js_loads(open("bundle.json", "rb").read())   # parsed the way JSON.parse parses it
report = nv.verify_bundle(bundle)             # did:key resolution, no network, no clock
print(report["verdict"], report["does_not_establish"])
print(nv.report_json(report))                 # JSON text as the JavaScript CLI prints it (not json.dumps)
print(nv.report_sha256(report))               # compare with the JavaScript run, byte for byte
```

One dependency, `cryptography`, for Ed25519. Nothing here opens a socket, except `tsugi-verify --fetch-operator-key
<origin>`, which fetches the operator key from the origin you name, and the two opt-in calls below
(`nenrin-a2a-record submit` / `flush(submit=True)`, and `policy.fetch_resume`).

## Record every A2A call your agent makes (0.4, `a2a_recorder`)

Two lines with the official A2A Python SDK (`pip install "nenrin-verify[a2a]"`):

```python
from nenrin_verify.a2a_recorder import Recorder
client = ClientFactory(config).create(card, interceptors=[Recorder(witness_name="acme-billing", key="witness.pem")])
```

From then on every outgoing call (send, stream, get_task, cancel, ...) is logged on your machine: method, time, the
salted sha256 of the request and of every response event, the final task state, and whether any result came back.
At exit (or `rec.flush()`) the calls become one Ed25519-signed `jidec-path-v1` record per agent endpoint, in
`nenrin-records/records/` (the exact body the NENRIN witness intake accepts), with the salt and the full log kept in
`nenrin-records/private/` (mode 600). Nothing is sent unless you file it. Content never leaves your machine; a
counterparty you show the private file to can match any call to its own logs (`a2a_recorder.matches`).

Each record lists what it establishes and what it does not, names the previous record for the same endpoint
(`prev_path_refs`, so a dropped day is a visible gap), and is checked against the ledger's own intake rules and the
resume assembler before it is written. A record says what came back from an agent you actually used, not whether
it was right; an unanswered call may be your own network, and the record says so.

    nenrin-a2a-record keygen witness.pem       # serve the public key at https://<your domain>/... and pass key_url=
    nenrin-a2a-record show                     # the records in ./nenrin-records
    nenrin-a2a-record verify nenrin-records/records/<sha>.json --private nenrin-records/private/<sha>.json
    nenrin-a2a-record submit nenrin-records/records/<sha>.json     # opt-in: file it at the public ledger

## Your rule, your decision (0.4, `policy`)

NENRIN never says whether to trust an agent. `policy.evaluate` applies a rule you write to a resume and returns a
decision anyone recomputes from (resume, rule, time). No score; every record counted or not counted is listed with
the reason, and the resume's own sha256 is recomputed rather than trusted.

```python
from nenrin_verify import policy
rule = {"min_independent_witnesses": 2, "within_days": 30, "max_fail": 0, "exclude_domains": ["mycompany.example"]}
d = policy.evaluate(policy.fetch_resume("https://agent.example/a2a"), rule)
print(d["allow"], d["reasons"])
```

By default a witness counts only by the domain its signing key is served from (`independence: "signed_domain"`),
and the measured agent's own domain never counts. `nenrin-policy <endpoint or resume.json> --rule rule.json` does
the same from a shell (exit 0 allow, 1 deny).

## What it verifies

| module | what | held to |
|---|---|---|
| `verify_provenance`, `consume_evidence`, `posture_line`, `candidate_evidence_set`, `preflight_report` | one A2A task's provenance graph: the delegation chain observed by third-party witnesses (R1 to R4, witness and edge signatures), the caller's grant and the provider's execution receipt (E1 to E3, caller and provider signatures), the provider's pre-execution intent, the outcome's evidence pointer, and the digest link between the layers | npm nenrin-verify 0.4.4 (`nenrin_verify.mjs`, verifier 0.1.6): the same report, key for key |
| `agreement_verify.verify`, `nenrin-agreement-verify` | a two-party agreement record (`a2a-agreement-v1`, `v1.1`), including key succession across a rotation | the repository's own Python verifier, unchanged but for one import line and a header comment; it and the JavaScript verifier return the same report on 5,286 frozen cases, and from npm nenrin-verify 0.3.0 the JavaScript command `nenrin-agreement-verify` prints what this one prints |
| `musubi.load`, `musubi-verify` | MUSUBI (a2a-contract-v0): a contract both parties signed, its settlement against anchored execution records (settle v1 to v1.10), offers, bonds, corrections, terms, independence, corroboration, and the spine that threads one contract through all of them | the repository's own files (`musubi-v0/`), byte for byte: MUSUBI is written in Python and has no JavaScript twin, so the guarantee is that installing changes nothing, each of its 18 modules passes its own self-test from the package, and the first settled execution (run0002) recomputes to its published hashes |
| `tsugi.verify_chain`, `tsugi-verify` | a TSUGI recovery chain (drift, proposal, authorization, execution, verify): every record's schema, hash and Ed25519 signature, order and links, strict mode (a human-approval repair needs an authorization signed by a trusted operator key, unexpired), the random witness draw recomputed from beacon, pool and subject, the commit-then-reveal anchor, the embedded witness observations and the quorum | `tsugi_verify.mjs` (verifier 0.3.1): the same stdout, byte for byte, and the same exit code |

## How "same report" is checked

The JavaScript file is the reference. The port reads it line for line, and every place where Python and
JavaScript disagree by default (`x or y` on `{}`, `==` on `True` and `1`, `Date.parse` accepting February 31st,
Node's lenient base64, an own `__proto__` key that Object.assign turns into a prototype, the order V8's sort
gives values a numeric comparator cannot order, `new URL(s).host`) goes through `src/nenrin_verify/_js.py` and
`src/nenrin_verify/_url.py`, so the differences can be read in one place.

- **Frozen.** 31 bundles signed with keys derived from a public phrase, covering accepted graphs, refusals of every
  layer, witness disagreement, provider equivocation, action bindings, non-ASCII and escapes, and the date edge
  cases. For each, the report, the `consume_evidence` projection and the CLI output are byte-identical to the
  JavaScript's. They ship in the package; `nenrin-verify --selftest` re-runs them on your machine.
- **Live.** Every path of every frozen bundle is broken in about twenty ways (deleted, nulled, retyped, shortened,
  reordered, timestamps and sequence numbers bent, own `__proto__` keys added, the whole bundle replaced by an
  array or null), 27,062 inputs in all. Each is run through the JavaScript verifier and through this port. Pass
  means both threw, or both returned the same report and projection. 0 differ.
- **Semantics.** The helpers in `_js.py` against Node directly: number text, Date.parse, Buffer base64, string
  escaping and mixed-type sorting, several thousand random values each.
- **Agreement.** The packaged agreement verifier returns every one of the 5,286 frozen reports in
  `agreement-v0/agreement_vectors_v1.json`, the file the JavaScript verifier is scored against.
- **Unchanged.** `VENDORED.json` pins the sha256 of the agreement files and their sources; a copy that drifts fails.
- **MUSUBI, byte for byte.** The 18 modules of `musubi-v0/` and the data their self-tests read sit in
  `src/nenrin_verify/_repo/musubi-v0/`, beside a byte-identical `agreement-v0/`, the layout each module expects; no
  line is edited, and `VENDORED.json` pins each to its source (the same sha256 twice). Byte identity matters beyond
  the proof: `correction_v0` fingerprints its own code files, so a correction bundle built from the repository
  verifies here only if the files are the same bytes. From the installed wheel, every module's own self-test
  passes (`musubi-verify --selftest`, 18/18) and run0002 recomputes to `b13a3869...` and `11c27fcf...`
  (`musubi-verify --run0002`). Not shipped: `gen_anchor_compose_fixture.py` (needs `opentimestamps`, regenerates a
  fixture) and `header_view_fetch.py` (fetches block headers over the network).
- **TSUGI, frozen.** 98 cases: the repository's three real chains (incident 2 with the real operator signature,
  12 records; the 7-record incident of the same week; that incident re-verified by a random draw of witnesses),
  under the command lines that matter, and edits of them that reach every one of the 69 refusal codes
  `tsugi_verify.mjs` has, plus the five inputs on which the JavaScript itself throws. Edited chains are re-sealed so
  an edit meets the rule it targets, not only a hash mismatch. For each, `node tsugi_verify.mjs` was run and its
  stdout and exit code frozen; they ship in the package and `nenrin-verify --selftest` re-runs them.
- **TSUGI, live.** Every path of the real chains and of the witness pool is edited in about twenty ways, raw and
  re-sealed: 29,326 inputs with the frozen cases. Each is run through `tsugi_verify.mjs` and through this port.
  0 differ; 3 edits put a non-ASCII host in an endpoint, and there the port raises `NotReproduced` instead of
  answering (see below).
- **TSUGI semantics.** `new URL(s).host`, `toLowerCase`, `Buffer.from` on any JSON value and string conversion of
  any JSON value, against Node directly, several thousand inputs each.

`report_sha256(report)` is the sha256 of the report with keys sorted by UTF-16 code unit at every depth, no
whitespace, strings and numbers as JSON.stringify writes them. The JavaScript side of the same hash is
`tests/parity/js_canon.mjs` (twelve lines).

## 0.4.7 (2026-10-05)

`musubi-verify --selftest` runs the 22 MUSUBI modules lower layers first and lets a nested self-test reuse the exact
result (exit code, stdout, stderr) of the same command when it already passed earlier in the same run. Most settle
self-tests end by running the self-test of the layer below, so the all-modules run used to repeat the lower layers many
times; it was too slow to finish on Windows (reported by @pipavlo82 in Issue #29). Measured here: 32 s before, 2 s
after, 22/22 either way. A module that failed is never reused, any other command runs for real, and the repository's
files are untouched (three are fingerprinted by correction_v0). A module run on its own (`musubi-verify settle_v1_10
--selftest`) still runs every layer under it, and `musubi-verify --selftest --no-reuse` runs every nested self-test
again. Checked against a broken settle_v1_8: v1.8, v1.9 and v1.10 all fail with reuse on, as they should.

## 0.4.6 (2026-10-05)

`canonical_v0.mjs`, the Node twin that contract_v0 uses to confirm its canonical bytes, decided whether it was the main
module by comparing `import.meta.url` with `"file://" + process.argv[1]`. On Windows that string never matches, so the
twin printed nothing and the contract_v0 self-test failed in a clean Windows venv (reported by @pipavlo82 in Issue #29,
Node 22.15.0). It now compares against `pathToFileURL(realpathSync(process.argv[1])).href`, which also holds when the file
is reached through a symlink. Its `--vectors` mode also reads canonical_vectors.json as published (`{rule, note,
vectors}`); before, it expected a bare list and threw. No canonical rule and no settlement rule changed.

The Python and JavaScript packages are versioned together where they share a verifier: compare Python 0.4.5 or 0.4.6
with npm nenrin-verify 0.4.4, not with an older npm pin. 0.4.5 and 0.4.6 change only MUSUBI, which has no JavaScript
twin in the npm package.

## 0.4.5 (2026-10-05)

MUSUBI settle v1.8, v1.9 and v1.10 now ship with the package, byte for byte from the repository, with what they need:
convergence_v0 and recovery-v0/recovery_verify.py (v1.9), and babyblueviper1's approver vectors (v1.10, CC0 vectors and
MIT code, their LICENSE included). `musubi-verify settle_v1_10 --selftest` runs from a plain venv, and
`musubi-verify settle_v1_10 --settle contract.json --event exec.json --view view.json` settles a contract whose
conditional actions require a pinned approver. The v1.10 self-test gained the rest of the approval lifecycle asked for
in Issue #29: a repeatable approval covering two executions, an approval for one action carried with another, and an
approval past valid_until_height. No settlement rule changed.

## 0.4.2 (2026-10-04)

Every signature check in this package now accepts a key only if it is the canonical encoding of a point of the
prime-order subgroup. A small-order Ed25519 key (the identity point, for example) verifies R = identity, S = 0 on
every message with no private key, and a mixed-order key (a real key plus a small-order point) lets one private key
pose as a second key; both are refused everywhere this package checks a signature: `provenance.did_key_resolver`
(verifier_version 0.1.5, in step with nenrin_verify.mjs), `tsugi` (verifier 0.3.1, in step with tsugi_verify.mjs),
`a2a_recorder.verify_payload` and the record check in `policy` (`provenance.ed25519_key_ok`). The base64 rule of
0.4.1 now covers them all too (`provenance.b64_exact`), and a TSUGI witness key counts once toward a quorum. The
frozen corpora were regenerated from the JavaScript files; no verdict changed. The agreement verifier is unchanged;
it already applied the same subgroup rule.

## 0.4.4 (2026-10-04)

Malformed records (a record slot or list element that is present but not an object, and not null/false) are refused
in their own step with reason record_not_object and are otherwise not presented, in step with verifier_version 0.1.6
(see the npm SDK.md and VERIFIER.md section 5). Before, the port threw on a non-object observation, as the JavaScript
did. No frozen verdict changed.

## 0.4.3 (2026-10-04)

A witness pool with a key that is not canonical base64 of a usable key is bad_pool, and an operator key passed to
`tsugi-verify` that is not a usable key is a usage error (exit 2, no report), as in the JavaScript command. Four frozen
TSUGI cases added (102 in all); no existing verdict changed.

## 0.4.1 (2026-10-04)

Two rules made strict in step with the JavaScript verifier (verifier_version 0.1.4, see the npm SDK.md): a timestamp
must be a real calendar instant (no 2026-02-30, no hour 24, no year 0000), and a signature field must be canonical
standard base64. The frozen parity corpus was regenerated from the JavaScript file; two bundles that pinned the old
lenient date reading are now refused with invalid_timestamp.

## Where the claim stops

- **Stack depth.** A document nested deep enough to exhaust a runtime's stack has no report in that runtime, and
  Node and Python run out at different depths (Node threw at 3,000 nested arrays inside a signed field, Python's
  default limit is 1,000). Real bundles are a few levels deep.
- **Sixty-four or more non-numeric `hop.seq` values in one bundle.** The order of those keys is V8's merge sort over
  a comparator that cannot order them; the port reproduces V8 for up to 63 keys and raises above that instead of
  guessing.
- Where the JavaScript throws, the port raises; the CLI then prints no report and exits 2 (Node exits 1 on an
  uncaught throw).
- **TSUGI: hosts that need UTS #46.** The verifier compares and prints URL hosts as WHATWG `new URL(s).host` gives
  them. The port follows the standard for ASCII hosts, IPv4 in every form the standard reads, ports and userinfo,
  and raises `NotReproduced` (no report, exit 2) for a host that is not ASCII after percent-decoding or has an
  `xn--` label, an IPv6 literal, or a `file:` URL. Lowercasing a code point this Python's Unicode tables do not
  assign raises the same way (Node 24 knows Unicode 16; Python 3.9 knows 13).
- **TSUGI: one refusal text depends on the Node release.** For an Ed25519 public key that is not 32 bytes, Node 24
  writes "Invalid keyData" and Node 22 "Ed25519 raw keys must be exactly 32-bytes". The port writes Node 24's
  (`tsugi.KEY_LENGTH_MESSAGE`); the tests compare Node 22's output after that one substitution.
- **TSUGI: `--fetch-operator-key`** makes the same request as the JavaScript (GET `<origin>/keys/operator.json`,
  404 read as no key) but is not part of the comparison, which runs offline.

## What it does not establish

What every report says itself, accepted or refused: a signature proves who asserted, not that the assertion is
true; E1 compares a provider's signed claim to a caller's signed authorization and has no side-effect oracle;
R1 proves a witness is structurally distinct from the parties, not unaffiliated with them. There is no score and
no allow or deny anywhere in this package. The decision belongs to whoever reads the evidence.

MUSUBI is the one part held to no second implementation, because there is none: its Python is the reference.
`musubi.load(name)` puts the two vendored directories at the front of `sys.path`, since that is how the modules
find each other (by bare name, as in the repository).
