"""The frozen TSUGI cases the Python port is held to, and what `node tsugi_verify.mjs` prints for each.

Inputs: the repository's three real chains (recovery-v0/incident_20260920_resign_chain.json, 12 records with the real
operator signature; recovery_fixture_20260920.json, the 7-record incident of the same week; witness_fixture_20260920.json,
the same incident re-verified by a random draw of witnesses with a commit-then-reveal anchor), each under the command
lines that matter, and edits of them that reach every refusal code tsugi_verify.mjs has. Edited chains are re-sealed
(tests/parity/tsugi_tools.py) so an edit is seen by the rule it targets and not only as a hash mismatch.

The JavaScript output is the reference: for each case the JavaScript CLI runs on the case's files and its stdout
and exit code are frozen. Node 22 writes one refusal text differently from Node 24 (a public key that is not 32 bytes,
see tsugi.KEY_LENGTH_MESSAGE); the frozen text is Node 24's.

    python make_tsugi_cases.py            write ../../src/nenrin_verify/tsugi_selftest.json.gz (the cases, their files and
                                          the JavaScript output, gzip-compressed: the chains repeat, and compress 20 to 1)
    python make_tsugi_cases.py --check    exit 1 if a re-run would write different content
