"""
MUSUBI clause evaluator v0: the one place that says how a single action reads against a signed grant.

Why this file exists. Settlement (settle v1.10, after the fact) and admission (a2a-admission-v0, before the act) must
give the same answer for the same action under the same contract. If each carried its own copy of the clauses, one
of them could drift and nobody would notice until a relying party admitted something a settler then called a
deviation. So the clauses live here, both import them, and every admission record names this file by sha256
(EVALUATOR_SHA256).

What moved here from settle_v1_10.py on 2026-10-10, unchanged: the pinned approver rule (approvers, gated_actions,
approver_approval_bytes, sign_approver_approval, verify_approver_approval, policy_reading and the reason list).
settle_v1_10 imports these names back, so its module namespace, its outputs and its self test are what they were.

What is stated here for the first time as a function: classify_action and evaluate_action. They restate, for one
action, the order the walk in settle v1.6 and v1.7 applies to every recorded action:

    authority ended by a revocation   -> revoked            (nothing else is looked at)
    past grant.expiry_height          -> after_expiry       (and the checks below still run)
    in grant.prohibited_actions       -> prohibited
    in grant.conditional              -> conditional unless a countable approval is carried
    not in grant.authorized_actions   -> unauthorized
    otherwise                         -> no deviation

The walks in settle_v1_6.py and settle_v1_7.py are published and are not edited; they keep their own lines. What
holds this restatement to them is a test, not a promise: admit_consistency.py runs every scenario through both and
fails on the first disagreement, and settle v1.11 recomputes every admission with evaluate_action.

Nothing here renders a verdict about a party. It returns clause names; the callers decide what to do with them.
