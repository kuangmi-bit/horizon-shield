"""nenrin-verify: recompute NENRIN evidence yourself, offline, in your own Python process.

The Python twin of the npm package nenrin-verify. Three verifiers held to their JavaScript counterparts, and MUSUBI:

  provenance   verify_provenance / consume_evidence: one A2A task's delegation chain, execution receipt,
               pre-execution intent and outcome evidence (port of nenrin_verify.mjs; same report, key for key)
  agreement    agreement_verify.verify: a two-party agreement record (a2a-agreement-v1 / v1.1), the repository's
               own Python verifier, which returns the same report as the JavaScript one on 5,286 frozen cases
  TSUGI        tsugi.verify_chain: a recovery chain (drift, proposal, authorization, execution, verify), strict
               operator keys, the random witness draw and its quorum (port of tsugi_verify.mjs; the same output,
               byte for byte, as `node tsugi_verify.mjs`)
  MUSUBI       musubi.load / musubi-verify: contracts, settlements and the spine (a2a-contract-v0). MUSUBI is
               written in Python and has no JavaScript twin; the package carries the repository's files byte for
               byte, so nothing has to be cloned to recompute a contract or a settlement

  TRACE        trace.verify_trace_intake / verify_trace_bind (0.5): whether the NENRIN ledger pins a TRACE Trust Record,
               and a nenrin-trace-bind-v0 record joining a NENRIN or MUSUBI record to a TRACE record (port of
               trace_verify.mjs; trace-bind-v0/SPEC.md); span_attributes / annotate_span put the bind on the agent's
               OpenTelemetry GenAI span

And two things for the agent you are building (0.4):

  a2a_recorder Recorder: a ClientCallInterceptor for the official A2A Python SDK. Every call your agent makes is
               recorded as a signed jidec-path-v1 witness record (salted hashes only, nothing sent unless you file)
  policy       evaluate: your own rule over a NENRIN resume ("2 signed-domain witnesses with PASS in 30 days, no
               FAIL"), a decision anyone recomputes from the resume, the rule and the time

The verifiers use no network, no clock and no score. A signature proves who asserted, not that the assertion is true; every report
says what it does not establish.
