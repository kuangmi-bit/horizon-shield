# External findings against conduct-v1

Findings made by people outside this project, what they found, what changed, and how the change was checked.
A finding is recorded here when it moved the specification, a reference server or the reference client. Each
entry names the evidence by sha256 so it can be recomputed without asking anyone. Records a finding rests on are
never edited after the fact; the fix is a new record beside them.

## EXT-001 (2026-09-27): `/endpoint` named a URL that did not serve the request

**Found by** Pavlo Tvardovskyi ([@pipavlo82](https://github.com/pipavlo82)), answering the public call for a second
independent witness ([issue #27](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/issues/27)). Walk taken from a
Windows PC he controls, with Codex assistance, using the reference client pinned at fb3339f3.

**The walk.** `POST https://gate.horizonshield.dev/a2a`, walked_at 2026-09-27T14:40:46Z, 5 of 5 applicable
assertions true, unsigned. Ledger record
[`eea3be5b34f46e4fb6c6eee89b9f5f1019e2b8b19c6106f2b660705550cbd2b4`](https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness/eea3be5b34f46e4fb6c6eee89b9f5f1019e2b8b19c6106f2b660705550cbd2b4).

**The finding, as a question.** The response metadata said `.../conduct/v1/endpoint =
https://gate.horizonshield.dev/mcp` for a request served by `/a2a`. He asked whether that was intentional.

**What was wrong.** Two things. Section 3 defined `.../endpoint` as "the entry of measured_endpoints that served this
request", and the gate, the ledger and the JIDEC agent answer A2A at `/a2a` while being measured elsewhere, so each
wrote a URL that did not serve the request (a hardcoded constant). The reference client read only the
`A2A-Extensions` header and never the metadata, so it passed the mismatch 5 of 5; its fixtures carried no metadata
at all, and one fixture agent answered with `.../endpoint = "x"` and passed.

**What changed.** Commit [18d83151](https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield/commit/18d83151), deployed
2026-09-28 (gate 0.4.16, ledger, JIDEC, KIRA):

- Specification v1.4, section 14 of `CONDUCT_EXT_v1.md`: `.../endpoint` narrowed to the measured endpoint whose record
  applies; a new `.../served_by` carries the URL the request arrived at, taken from the request, never a constant.
- Servers: all four write `.../served_by` from the request.
- Client: `metadata_echoed` and `endpoint_bound`. A `served_by` that names another URL is false even when `.../endpoint`
  equals the walked URL, one step stricter than the rule first announced on #27; section 14.4 records the difference.
- `walk_reference_servers.py`: the unchanged client against the four real servers, locally, both wires. Against the
  code as it was when he walked, it reproduces the finding (gate, ledger, JIDEC false; KIRA true).

**Independent verification, by the finder.** From the same vantage, with the client pinned at 18d83151:
76/76 self-tests; a live A2A 1.0 walk of `/a2a` at 7 of 7 applicable, `metadata_echoed` and `endpoint_bound` true;
his original captured response replayed through the new client at 6 of 7 with `endpoint_bound=false`; a copy with
only `served_by` changed to `/wrong` at 6 of 7, FAIL. Ledger record
[`8cde797444d329971b91c924a57df1171a31e5cf81ba51d61724122d71ed6a3e`](https://ledger.horizonshield.dev/witness/8cde797444d329971b91c924a57df1171a31e5cf81ba51d61724122d71ed6a3e)
(walked_at 2026-09-27T16:21:17Z, stored, not counted: same witness, same endpoint, same day). His own scope, kept as
he stated it: this confirms the gate `/a2a` binding fix on the 1.0 wire from one vantage; it does not reverify the
other servers, the 0.3 wire, card signatures, or witness-pool admission, and it is not a second counted witness.

**The exchange** is public on issue #27: the question, the answer and fix plan before the fix was written, the
report after deploy (with two corrections to the first answer), the finder's verification, and the reply.

**What this does not establish.** That the other servers behave correctly from his vantage; that a second
independent witness exists in the counted pool (the pool admits only domain-signed witnesses that declare
reciprocity, and he is not counted there on his behalf).

## EXT-000 (2026-09-11): an endpoint that charges was recorded as an endpoint that failed

Found by walking a real agent that charges for calls, `api.babyblueviper.com` (Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos),
walk sha256 `9e058efa16789bb1911eb237a160f7c3bcebc520ba3ee4d74f6d469d02648eb8`. The client recorded 402 Payment
Required the same as a broken endpoint, and answered a question about the compensation declaration with a reason
about the extension. Fixed in specification v1.3, section 13 (`payment_required_as_declared`, 402 as an answer, a walk
never pays) and in the client; details there. Numbered EXT-000 because it predates this file.
