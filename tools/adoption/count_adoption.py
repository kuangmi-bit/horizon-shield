"""Count, once a week, how far NENRIN has moved from "people check HORIZON SHIELD" to "people use it without us".

Five numbers, each from a source a stranger can read, none typed by hand:

  independent_implementations  implementations by other authors that reproduced our bytes or verdicts.
                               Source: tools/adoption/registry.json (hand-kept rows, each with a public link);
                               this script checks every link still answers and counts rows and distinct authors.
  independent_witnesses        domains outside this project that signed a walk and filed it to the ledger.
                               Source: every nenrin-witness-batch-v1 entry on https://ledger.horizonshield.dev,
                               field signed_domain. Unsigned walks are listed by name and not counted. The TSUGI
                               re-verification pool (recovery-v0/pool_report.json) is reported beside it.
  external_contracts           MUSUBI contracts signed by both sides with a party that is not this project, and
                               separately those with no party from this project at all.
                               Source: the signed contracts committed under workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0.
  external_evidence_producers  distinct outside identities that signed anything the evidence layer keeps: a
                               ledger witness walk, a contract, an agreement record. The union of the above.
  outside_trace_pins           distinct TRACE signing keys (RFC 7638 thumbprints) not listed as ours whose records
                               were pinned with trace-pin-v0. Source: every nenrin-trace-pin-batch-v0 entry on the
                               ledger plus the pending pool (GET /evidence/trace/pending). The TRACE registry asked
                               for this count before it would consider holding a copy of the ledger.
  third_party_ci_reproductions public repositories, not owned by this project, created from
                               conduct-witness-template whose weekly reproduce workflow succeeded in the last 30
                               days. Source: the GitHub REST API (search, repository, workflow runs).

A source that cannot be read is reported as not measured, with the reason, and its number is null. It is never
counted as zero: an outage of ours is not a finding about anyone.

    python3 tools/adoption/count_adoption.py            # print the count
    python3 tools/adoption/count_adoption.py --write    # also write ops/adoption/ and the README block
    python3 tools/adoption/count_adoption.py --check    # exit 1 if the README block differs from latest.json

GITHUB_TOKEN, when set, is sent to api.github.com only (higher rate limit). Standard library only.
