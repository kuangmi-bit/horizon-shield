## How it is measured

- Once an hour a GitHub Actions hosted runner probes each endpoint in turn, with a 20 second timeout per request.
- MCP endpoints: `initialize` (protocol 2025-06-18, accepting JSON or an SSE framed answer, keeping any `mcp-session-id`), `tools/list`, then one read only `tools/call` named in `tools/status/endpoints.json`. HTTP endpoints: one GET of a documented JSON path.
- Reach: the first step answered correctly (`initialize` returned a result, or the GET returned the expected JSON). Call success: the `tools/call` returned a result without `isError` (for HTTP, the GET). Runs where the endpoint was not reached count as failed calls.
- Latency is the time until the whole answer was read. P50 and P95 are nearest rank over the last 7 days; a timeout counts as 20000 ms; connection errors have no latency.
- Server version and tool count are what the endpoint itself reported in its last successful `initialize` and `tools/list`.

## What it does not establish

- One vantage point: one runner region per run, chosen by GitHub and not disclosed (usually the United States). Users in Japan or elsewhere may see very different times.
- One sample per endpoint per hour. A short outage between samples is not seen; one slow sample moves a 24 hour figure a lot.
- It is not a measure of user experience, of correctness of the answers, or of any tool other than the one called.
- Scheduled GitHub runs can start late or be skipped under load; a missing hour is a gap in the data, not an outage.
- The probe's own calls are counted by the servers' usage counters where those exist.
