ops/agreement_second_record_finalize.py

Writes the UNSIGNED canonical a2a-agreement-v1.1 record for the SECOND bilateral record between
HORIZON SHIELD and Federico (babyblueviper.com): the mutual a2a-conduct-v1 walks of 2026-09-24.
Unlike the first record (JIDEC entry 34, self-measured), each party here pins the OTHER's endpoint,
walked live and passing 5/5, and Federico's side is signed and content-addressed on his own host.

It signs nothing, fetches nothing, never touches a private key. Standard library only, Python 3.8+.
All known values are baked as defaults from the 2026-09-25 prep run, so it runs with no arguments.

    python3 ops/agreement_second_record_finalize.py

The counterparty (Federico) walked gate.horizonshield.dev; HORIZON SHIELD walked
api.babyblueviper.com. That is why party B's conduct subject_domain is gate.horizonshield.dev here,
not mcp.horizonshield.dev as in the first record.
